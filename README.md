# Form-cycle

This little utility cycles through lists of strings, inserting the
next string in the list each time the function form-cycle-initiate
is called. Please see the video below to get an idea of how this tool
can be used when programming in Common Lisp.

## Loading

To get started with the Common Lisp patterns, do the following:

- load form-cycle.el
- load example-lisp-patterns.el
- bind the function form-cycle-lisp-patterns to a suitable key
- (optional) bind the function form-cycle-lisp-patterns-ido to another suitable key
- (optional) customize the example patterns to your liking, or even replace them completely
